# CAPOIRL TF2
## Install

This library has been tested on Python 3.7 and TensorFlow 2.2.  
We provide two installation option depending on the use of TensorFlow with CPU or GPU.

### TensorFlow CPU

A requirements.txt file is provide with the minimum required dependencies.
complete_requirements.txt include an extended list of dependencies in case that requirements.txt where not enough.

If tensorflow is not working on GPU try to install it through:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.2
```

We include some jupyter notebooks tutorials on how to use the library. These tutorials are ordered and increasingly 
include the most important features of this library.
